A modified version of the Cinnamon window list applet that provides some extra
knobs.

This is currently based on the window list shipped in Cinnamon 3.6.7.

## Installation

Get the code:

```sh
mkdir -p HOME/.local/share/cinnamon/applets
git clone https://github.com/LawnGnome/cinnamon-window-list.git $HOME/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/window-list@adamharvey.name
```

Then enable it in the applet configuration and add it to a panel.
